# Self Assessment 2021 - 22

### TL;DR
Cloud's revenue went from 30 L in 2020-21 to 1.4 Cr in 2021-22. I'll get it to 5 Cr in 2022-23.

## Cloud
I'm slightly closer to the goal than when we started. For a few minutes now, let's stew in a steaming pile of mediocrity and get this over with.

### Infrastructure
- Docker now works. Haven't seen any issues since the migration to Single Container Benches.
- New signups on AWS. Live in 5 regions.
- Out of box Monitoring and Alerting that, just works.
- Centralized Logging more or less works.
- Simple Telegram Bot takes care of some operational tasks.
- Website analytics moved to [Plausible](https://analytics.frappe.cloud).

Tiny features like Binary Log Browser, Slow Query Log rarely get used and make life less painful than it needs to be. 

### Premium Features
SSH and DB access seem to have broken new ground here. I'll keep finding and building these. E.g. People keep asking for "Dedicated cores" for guaranteed performance.

### Dedicated Machines
This has been the slowest delivery so far, still not released, but we've now found one customer here. The ticket size is 10-20x the normal.

### Enterprise
Thanks to Rushabh we seem to have found an opening. I have no idea what the user expectations are going to be here but these can be $100k ARR deals for us.

### Marketplace
An Absolute Disaster. I just dropped the ball here. 100% failure at setting clear expectations here and following through.

Hussain has already done good work here and is interested in driving growth. I'm sure this will work out very well for us. If it doesn't then one way or the other I'll make sure we deliver the maximum value we possibly can.

## Team
I'm probably not cut out for "Leadership". So far I don't seem to be good at delegating and motivating people to monetize.

The team is doing everything on their own now. Balamurali has taken over Infra/Ops, Hussain has started monetizing Marketplace, and Rutwik is working on SaaS. I either stay aloof or meddle too much. You can't blame me here, after all, I've learned from the best.

My most recent idea is **Equal Responsibility - Equal Attribution - Equal Reward**. Maybe extreme ownership will solve everything and potentially make my job easier or fail as everything else has. I will pay constant attention to things here since I have been once burnt by [not paying constant attention to things](https://gameplan.frappe.io/t/frappe-cloud-march-2021/930/2?u=aditya), not interested in failing again.

## Unhealthy
I have grown a very unhealthy attachment with my work and it is bringing insanity to my otherwise pointless life. Cloud continues to bring a lot of misery and chaos. I don't think it's just me since it wreaks havoc and brings misery to everything else it touches. I am enjoying this pain now.

Everything has changed since we started. Entropy will continue to strip away everything I have done, there's nothing I can do about it. I just have to keep putting everything together faster than it breaks. 

At least for now I'm more or less alone in this. Faris claims about not giving him any credit, I'm sorry if it ever came out that way. We were supposed to be partners in this and he left me to do this on my own. Maybe I'm still hung up on it.

## Motivation
I've now accepted that one of the most democratic institutions, Death, eventually comes to us all. So we're doomed anyway.

We call ourselves underachievers, we're very unlikely winners. Nobody will ever bet on us. It's easy to be a cynic and say this won't work but I can't survive not knowing whether we could do this.

One day our quixotic pursuits in truth will come to an end and I'll crash and burn, but I'm having fun.

## Compensation

I drove Cloud from 30 L to 1.4 Cr. Well over 4x. I propose 10 L Cash + 30 L in Options (at 25k/Option, 120 Options i.e 0.45%).

If this doesn't seem fair then I can opt for an arbitrarily long vesting period, e.g. 6,8,10 years, that doesn't matter, since I've promised to forever stay with Frappe.

One more premium ask. I'm requesting the "Founder - Frappe Cloud" title.

## Now what?
- We're growing at 10-15% monthly, Capitalize on this momentum and deliver 5 Cr Revenue on 2022-23.
- Take the Cloud experience from Meh to Magical! From Documentation, Marketing, Support to UX (Most of the good parts come from Faris's work with Dashboard, Since then everything has gone downhill).
- SaaSify everything. Exhaust the ERPNext market. Find new ones.
- Monetize everything. Find and exploit every source of potential growth.
- Keep lighting fires under everyone's asses.
- Stay hungry and keep pushing the team, and there's no plan B.

When this happens, I will gauge your eyes out and ask for 2% Options. You probably won't care since you'll have gotten the growth most of the company so desperately wants.
